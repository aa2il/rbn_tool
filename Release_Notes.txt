 RBN Analysis Tool - by AA2IL
------------------------------

Tool to analyze the spot data from the Reverse Beacon Network.

Sample usage - To see where I was being heard while running during one of the recent CWTs (0300 session on July 28, 2022),

rbn_tool.py 20220728.csv -t1 3 -hours 1 -na

-t1 specifies the start time in hours UTC
-hours specifies the duration of the interval of interest
-na filters spots to only those in North America 

See README.md for more usage examples.  Download the archived RBN data from https://www.reversebeacon.net/raw_data .
